      When you access Wolfram|One in the cloud for the first time, you can create a new notebook or load a
      pre-made
      Things to Try live notebook, which is designed to guide you through neat things you can immediately
      compute.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      You can use Wolfram|One to create instant web apps and APIs, or to deploy to mobile. The Wolfram
      Language is also
      bundled on the Raspberry Pi, where you can connect directly to hardware, including Arduino etc.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The fastest way to get an API up and running is detailed in the extensive Documentation Center
      available to you
      alongside your notebook: simply click the section in the documentation labeled Cloud and Deployment
      and select
      Instant APIs to access a handy how-to guide to help get you started.

      If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to get a
      project started:
      decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework, pick a styling framework. A
      while later,
      you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then can other team members start
      contributing.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      The primary focus is on simplicity and ease of use. The owner of this project also tried to make it
      as generic and reusable
      as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific.
